`MONGO_URI` is the Connection URL to your DB
To get the connection URL there are two ways

#1 [Mongo Atlas](http://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account \
After you set up your account create a new Cluster \
Then copy the connection url to your cluster
([Mongo-Atlas-Guide](https://github.com/Synthesized-Infinity/Void-Guides/blob/main/Mongo-Atlas-guide.md))

#2 If you don't want to use Mongo Atlas you can install MongoDB in your system and use the URI provided in `.env.example`
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) to install MongoDB in your system

`EIF` is the main endpoint of the [Express-is-fun APIs](https://express-is-fun.herokuapp.com/api). \
If you want the chatbot functionality add this url there: `https://express-is-fun.herokuapp.com`. Leave it empty if you don't want the chatbot functionality
